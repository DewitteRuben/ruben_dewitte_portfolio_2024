summary: "A foundation for an online marketplace where users can buy and sell decoration-related goods."
---

Many online marketplaces are available today, such as Amazon, eBay, and Google Express. While most of these platforms offer a wide range of products, some cater to specific audiences. For example, Etsy focuses on handmade or vintage items, and Vinted is dedicated to selling (and swapping) clothes and accessories.

Inspired by these niche platforms, I envisioned an online marketplace for decoration-related goods, taking cues from the German retail store 'Depot,' which specializes in decor items. This prototype aims to create a platform where users can buy and sell various decoration-related products.

## Project Scope

The project includes the following features:

- **Categorization:** Items sorted by type, subcategory, etc., with categories accessible via URL (e.g., /decoration/vases-and-flowers/wreath/flowers).
- **Filtering and Sorting:** Options by price, popularity, and date.
- **User Accounts:** Registration, login, profile management, and viewing of other profiles.
- **Item Management:** Add, edit, and remove items.
- **Shopping Experience:** Shopping cart and wishlist functionality.
- **Payment Integration:** PayPal integration.

## Design Approach

To ensure the marketplace is clear and easy to use, I opted for a minimalistic design created using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).
