---

To learn more about integrating interactive maps (such as Google Maps or Mapbox) and WebRTC in mobile applications, I decided to create a GPS Tracker mobile app.

The app allows users to track their own location, create routes, share their location in real-time, and make video calls. This app can be used to track a traveling family member, share a road trip with a friend, or record your own bike ride.

Users can share a unique passcode with people they want to be tracked by. This passcode allows others to track their location.

## Tech Stack

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) with [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management
- [React Native WebRTC](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-webrtc) for peer-to-peer video and audio streaming
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)'s Realtime Database for transmitting location data
- Socket.io for STUN and TURN server setup needed for WebRTC
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) as the web server
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for both front-end and back-end development

## Functionality

### Save, Edit, and View Routes

While tracking, after covering a minimum distance (default is 10 meters), users can save the current route. If they choose to save it, they will be prompted to provide details about the route.

    {
      src: "/images/gpsapp/gpsapp-conclude-route.jpg",
      width: 720,
      height: 1337,
    },
    {
      src: "/images/gpsapp/gpsapp-save-route.jpg",
      width: 720,
      height: 1336,
    },
  ]}
/>

Users can later view and edit their saved routes.

      src: "/images/gpsapp/gpsapp-saved-routes.jpg",
      width: 720,
      height: 1336,
    },
    {
      src: "/images/gpsapp/gpsapp-edit-route.jpg",
      width: 720,
      height: 1336,
    },
    {
      src: "/images/gpsapp/gpsapp-view-route.jpg",
      width: 720,
      height: 1336,
    },
  ]}
/>

### Sharing Location

When the mobile app is first launched, a unique [ID](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shortid) is generated. This ID is specific to the mobile app and can be reset by clearing the appâ€™s data.

<PhotoSwipeGallery
  id="result"
  col={2}
  images={[
    {
      src: "/images/gpsapp/gpsapp-settings.jpg",
      width: 720,
      height: 1336,
    },
  ]}
/>

This ID can be used to view the GPS location of the person using the standalone web application. Entering a valid ID will display the tracker's GPS location on an interactive map.

    {

      width: 1920,
      height: 937,
    },
    {
      src: "/images/gpsapp/webapp-track-example.png",
      width: 1920,
      height: 937,
    },
  ]}
/>

### Video Call (up to 2 peers in the latest version)

When the WebRTC option is enabled in the settings menu, the tracker can request a video call via the web application.

<PhotoSwipeGallery

  col={2}
  images={[
    {
      src: "/images/gpsapp/gpsapp-settings-webrtc.jpg",
      width: 720,
      height: 1337,
    },
    {
      src: "/images/gpsapp/gpsapp-connection-request.jpg",
      width: 720,
      height: 1336,
    },
  ]}
/>

WebRTC uses [STUN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN) and/or [TURN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT) servers to establish a peer-to-peer connection between users.

    },
  ]}
/>
